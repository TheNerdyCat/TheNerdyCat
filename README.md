# The Nerdy Cat | Data Science Extraordinaire
👋 I'm Edward 👋

My Maine Coon cat, Perkins, started my Data Science journey with me many years ago and is a genius, which is why I have a picture of him looking funny and wearing glasses. He is massive, and super smart. I have in since got a Ragdoll cat called Benvolio. He is not smart, but extremely fluffy and cute.

🏢 I'm a co-founder of a Data Science Consultancy called TwoKai. We're new, but have high aspirations.

👀 I'm not super clever, but I'm excellent at searching Stack Overflow.
